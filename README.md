# Early Hints Worker

A Cloudflare Worker that uses [HTMLRewriter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter/) in
order to select assets from the page that we want to include in [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link)
headers, so that Cloudflare can cache these and emit [103 Early Hints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/about/early-hints/) responses.

## Blog Post

Curious about what each part of the code does and why it's used?

Check out my [blog post!](https://kian.org.uk/implementing-103-early-hints-with-cloudflare-workers-htmlrewriter/)

## Notes

If your site has a lot of `img`/`script`/`link[rel=stylesheet]` elements, you will want to make sure you're scoping the selectors to the specific ones you want to preload! If your `link` header gets too large, this can cause issues - many servers or CDNs limit the size of an individual header to 8192B (8KB).

Take a look at the [Don't Overhint!](https://kian.org.uk/implementing-103-early-hints-with-cloudflare-workers-htmlrewriter/#dont-overhint) section of the blog post.

## Requirements

- [A Cloudflare Account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers) and a website using Cloudflare.
- [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2)

## Preconnect Domains

103 Early Hints also supports `rel=preconnect` hints - this will 'warm up' the connection ahead of requesting resources
and is good for assets that don't necessarily need preloading, but you will be fetching soon after the page load.

The recommendation is to do this for important third-party origins, i.e Google Analytics or Google Fonts
> Preconnect Link headers to important third-party origins (e.g. an origin hosting the pagesâ€™ assets, or Google Fonts).

In order to configure this, add an array of domains to the `preconnect_domains` variable in `wrangler.toml`.

```toml
[vars]
preconnect_domains = ["https://kian.org.uk", "https://www.google-analytics.com"]
```

## Instructions

1. Make sure that Early Hints is enabled in [Speed -> Optimization](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/speed/optimization)
2. Clone the repository.
3. Make sure that your `wrangler` logged in to your Cloudflare account.
4. Open `wrangler.toml` and add a `route` key as necessary to make the Worker run on your website.
```toml
route = { pattern = "example.com/*", zone_name = "example.com" } 
```
5. If necessary, make any changes to the HTML element selectors or add `rel=preconnect` hints as per [preconnect domains](README.md#preconnect-domains).
6. Run `wrangler publish` and the Worker will be live on your website!
